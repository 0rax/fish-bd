**Quickly go back to a parent directory up in your current working directory tree.**
**Don't write 'cd ../../..' redundantly, use bd instead.**

This is a fish implementation of [vigneshwaranr/bd](https://github.com/vigneshwaranr/bd) by Vigneshwaran Raveendran

## Usage
```
# fish-bd v1.3.0 (https://github.com/0rax/bd-fish)

Description:
    Quickly go back to a parent directory up in your current working directory tree.
    Don't write 'cd ../../..' redundantly, use bd instead.

Usage:
    bd [option] <directory name>

Examples:
    # You are in /home/user/my/path/is/very/long/
    # And you want to go back to 'path', simple type
    > bd path
    # or
    > bd -s pa
    # or
    > bd -i P
    # And you are now in /home/user/my/path/

Options:
    -c      Classic mode : goes back to the first directory named as the string (default)
            Set if default using (set -gx BD_OPT 'classic')
            Default mode when BD_OPT or CLI options are specified
    -s      Seems mode : goes back to the first directory containing string
            Set it as default using (set -gx BD_OPT 'sensitive')
    -i      case insensitive move (implies seems mode)
            Set it as default using (set -gx BD_OPT 'insensitive')
    -h      Print this help and exit
```
